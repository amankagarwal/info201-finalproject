## Our objectives 
In this project, we use the dataset which has data for all the e-sports competitive League of Legends games from 2015 to 2017 to find different trends, and compare how different pro-players have performed at the competitive level. The goal is to learn how games are influenced, what champions are banned/played, and what matters most when it comes to winning the game.


## So what is League of Legends, and how does it work?
The objective of the game is simple - destroy the enemy nexus. In order to do this, champions must traverse down one of three different paths (or lanes) in order to attack their enemy at their weakest points they can exploit. Both teams have their lanes defended by numerous turrets; each turret grows in strength the closer it gets to its respective nexus and each turret must be eliminated in order to gain access to the next turret in that lane. Cooperating with fellow summoners is an absolute requirement for success, as it is easy for a champion to find themselves ambushed by enemies in the lanes of the Rift.
