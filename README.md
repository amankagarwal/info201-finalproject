# info201-finalproject
In this project, we will use a dataset which has data for all competitive League of Legends games from 2015 go 2017. We plan to find different trends,
and also compare how different pro-players have performed at the big stage. The final trends/analytics will be displayed on a web page using Shiny Apps.

## Remove this later:

So, I have created a basic template on how the tabs in our page will look.
Instead of writing all our code in a single server.R and ui.R file, it will be much easier if we keep all data-wrangling and calculations,
for **each tab** in a different R file, and then refer to it in our server files.

Also, creating branches here will be really helpful- if one of us uploads a code which is broken, it would not affect the other person's progress.

Dividing work:
Each one of us should work on **atleast** one tab, therefore must create one R file which deals with one of the issues. I (Aman) will take care of the main logic files (ui.R and server.R), so don't worry about that.
