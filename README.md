# info201-finalproject
In this project, we will use a dataset which has data for all competitive League of Legends games from 2015 go 2017. We plan to find different trends,
and also compare how different pro-players have performed at the big stage. The final trends/analytics will be displayed on a web page using Shiny Apps.
